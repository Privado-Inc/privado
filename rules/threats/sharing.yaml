    name: "Content provider configuration leaks sensitive data"
    type: Threat
    description: >-
      As part of Android's IPC mechanisms, content providers allow an app's stored data to be accessed and modified by other apps. 
      If not properly configured, these mechanisms may leak sensitive data.
    fix: >-
      Ensure proper configurations are in place when using the content providers.

    name: "App notification is leaking sensitive data"
    type: Threat
    description: >-
      Sensitive information might be leaked to third parties via app notification. It is important to understand that notifications 
      should never be considered private. When a notification is handled by the Android system it is broadcasted system-wide and 
      any application running with a NotificationListenerService can listen for these notifications to receive them in full and may 
      handle them however it wants. There are many known malware samples such as Joker, and Alien which abuses the 
      NotificationListenerService to listen for notifications on the device and then send them to attacker-controlled C2 infrastructure. 
      Commonly this is done in order to listen for two-factor authentication (2FA) codes that appear as notifications on the device 
      which are then sent to the attacker. A safer alternative for the user would be to use a 2FA application that does not generate 
      notifications. Furthermore there are a number of apps on the Google Play Store that provide notification logging, which 
      basically logs locally any notifications on the Android system. This highlights that notifications are in no way private on 
      Android and accessible by any other app on the device.
      
      For this reason all notification usage should be inspected for confidential or high risk information that could be used by malicious applications. 
      If not properly configured, these mechanisms may leak sensitive data.
    fix: >-
      Ensure that no sensitive data is exposed via notification system.
