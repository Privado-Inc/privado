      Finding Sensitive Information in Auto-Generated Screenshots: Manufacturers want to provide device users with an aesthetically 
      pleasing experience at application startup and exit, so they introduced the screenshot-saving feature for use when the application 
      is backgrounded. This feature may pose a security risk. Sensitive data may be exposed if the user deliberately screenshots the 
      application while sensitive data is displayed. A malicious application that is running on the device and able to continuously 
      capture the screen may also expose data. Screenshots are written to local storage, from which they may be recovered by a rogue 
      application (if the device is rooted) or someone who has stolen the device.
    fix: >-
      Ensure that FLAG_SECURE option is set on the window.
