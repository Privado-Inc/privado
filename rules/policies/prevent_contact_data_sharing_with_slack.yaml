policies:  
  
  #  .* is a regular expression. Meaning the policy structure supports regex(case-sensitive).
  #
  #  The tags field in each policy object are the tags for referencing the policy.
  #  These are not to be associated with sources'/sinks' tags.
  #
  #  In case no sinks key is defined inside a policy:
  #  The policy will evaluate to true for any processing instance of corresponding sources being found
  #  Thus a missing sink implies any kind of processing is Allowed/NotAllowed for given source
