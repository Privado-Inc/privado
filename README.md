Privado is an open source static code analysis tool to discover data flows in the code. It detects the personal data being processed, and further maps the journey of the data from the point of collection to going to interesting sinks such as third parties, databases, logs, and internal APIs.

# Quick Start

Follow these 3 simple steps to get started with Privado

### Download Privado CLI

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Privado-Inc/privado-cli/main/install.sh | bash
```

### Scan your repository

```
privado scan <source directory>
```

You can download and use this [sample application](https://github.com/saurabh-sudo/BankingSystem-Backend) to test Privado


### Get results

The results are generated at `<source directory>/.privado/privado.json`

### Visualize results

To visualize the results and generate reports, you can create a free account at the end of a successful scan. Once a scan is complete, it will ask your permission to synchronize the generated results with Privado Cloud Dashboard. Note that **no code is sent to the cloud**. Upon successful sync, you can view the results on our free platform.

# How does Privado work?
Privado can be run locally on your computer or in your CI/CD pipeline. During the scanning process, Privado creates a knowledge graph that answers thousands of questions about sensitive data contextually. You never have to worry about your code leaving your machine since the scan is local. An output file is stored in JSON format. The results can be viewed on Privado Cloud.

# What does the scan discover?
Upon scanning a repository, Privado will discover the following information in the code and presents it in a nice dashboard for your review.

-   Data Elements
-   Data Flow Diagrams
-   Data Inventory
-   Code Analysis
-   Issues
    
# What can I do with Privado?
Apart from getting a comprehensive outlook of your data practices for Privacy Audits, you can also use the tool to generate various privacy reports to comply with privacy laws like GDPR and CCPA.

## Record of Processing Activity ( ROPA ) Report
Our free cloud platform can be used to generate RoPA reports for a single, as well as a combination of repositories added to the platform. Check out how to create a RoPA report for your repository.

## Data Safety Report
Data Safety Report is a privacy form that is needed to publish any Android app on the Play Store. Currently, to fill the data safety form developers have to ask around in the team to find what data they are collecting, spend hours reading the documentation of SDKs to find data shared, and navigate the complex Playstore form. With our scan, we pre-fill data types collected, shared, and guide you with our wizard to generate the data safety report.

# Supported languages
Java is the first language we support. As part of the Enterprise offering, Privado supports all languages. To open source a language, the architecture change is required so that community contributions can be made easily. We are working on open sourcing support for the other languages.
