# Third Parties

Modern day applications are assembled by using many third party libraries.  Example: use SendGrid for sending automated emails to customer or Stripe for payments. The personal data may flow to the third parties which are not accounted. The third parties are integrated either via api-to-api mechanism or by using specific SDKs. Privado letâ€™s you detect data flows to third parties. 

The rules for third parties are under directory `rules/sinks/third_parties/`:
