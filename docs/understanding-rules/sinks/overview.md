Sinks are the destinations where personal data is being sent in the code. They are further categorised into storages, leakages, third parties, and internal apis. These top-level categories are aligned with the usages of the data. The top-level categories are further divided into sub-categories. For example, Storages are divided into MongoDB, MySQL, PSQL, etc. At the lowest level, rules are stored as per the programming languages. There will be a file for every language. The rules which are applicable to all the programming languages are stored in the `default.yaml` files.
