# Understanding privado.json

Privado saves the scan results in a JSON file, `.privado/privado.json` in the repository directory where you ran the scan. The JSON contains all the information generated by the scan. the structure of the file can be interpreted as follows:

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/image (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The `privado.json` structures the results into 5 sections excluding the metadata about the repository. This file can be imported into the Privado Dashboard for visualization or fed into any custom integrations like Slack, JIRA, or SIEM Tools To understand the structure of each section of the result, check out the following docs:

* [Sources](sources.md)
* [Processing](processing.md)
* [Data Flows](data-flow.md)
* [Collections](collections.md)
* [Violations](violations.md)
