## Visualize results

To visualize the results and generate reports, you can create a free account at the end of a successful scan. Once a scan is complete, it will ask your permission to synchronize the generated results with Privado Cloud Dashboard. Note that **no code is sent to the cloud**. Upon successful sync, you can view the results on our free platform.
